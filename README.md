# Project 1: Weather-Part 1

## Introduction to the Consultancy Brief

This data analysis project seeks to use the data provided to determine the variables which relate to Actual Temperature and Apparent Temperature as it pertains to both explanation and prediction. To achieve this, the project has been divided into 2 phases. 

In **Part 1**, the initial data analysis is conducted to explore the data. This involves the following:

* •	Summary statistics, tables and graphics to investigate the location, distribution and spread of the data and reporting on any unusual observations, possible data entry errors and any outliers, missing values or other inconsistencies and draw appropriate conclusions

* •	Data preparation: Cleaning the data while maintaining the integrity of the data. Identifying the different data formats, types and structures as well as making sure the data is unbiased and credible. 

Furthermore, a determination of relationships among the variables in pairs is required, this may be done using scatter plots to determine whether there is a relationship between any two variables so long as one of them is a variable of interest such as Actual Temperature or Apparent Temperature. For example, answering the question, what type of relationship exits between Actual Temperature and Humidity? etc.  

Finally, hypothesis testing is done to make inferences about the wider dataset. One sample and two sample hypothesis tests are conducted to determine whether there is enough statistical evidence in favour of stated hypothesis.

**Part 2** of the project involves the creation of regression models for Actual Temperature and Apparent Temperature. This will directly contribute to the overall project objective stated above. A regression analysis is done to explain variability in dependent variable by means of one or more of independent variables. Correlation is a measure of dependence or statistical relationship between two random variables or two sets of data. This will be further reported on in part 2 of the project.
The entire statistical work is conducted in R studio. However, the data is provided in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and data cleaning may be conducted in Microsoft Excel for ease of execution. 

**The Appendix** section of this document contains all R commands and outputs where relevant.
